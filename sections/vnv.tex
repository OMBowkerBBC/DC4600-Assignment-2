\section{Is the project V \& V approved?}
  V \& V refers to \textit{'Validation'} and \textit{'Verification'}. In this section I will discuss why I think this project is v \&
  v approved as well as discuss more about the deployment and testing of the new system.

  \begin{quote}
    \textit{'The aim of validation is to ensure that the software meets the customer's expectations'} [TODO1]
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
    \textit{'The aim of verification is to check that the software meets its stated functional and non-functional requirements'} [TODO1]
  \end{quote}

  \subsection{Testing}

  Software testing is a huge part of verifying that the software written is up to a high standard and works as intended. When software is not
  tested issues such as poor quality, performance and user experience, security vulnerabilities and increased maintenance cost [TODO2] can all 
  occur.

    \label{fig:testingPyramid}
  \end{figure}

  The testing pyramid above shows the types of testing ACME performs as well as demonstrates the quantity of each type of test.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unit Tests} - These can be described as \textit{'consist[ing] in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, 
    or modules'} [TODO4]. A simple example of a unit test would be to make sure a function that adds two number together, provides the expected result
    when given those two numbers. Mocking, \textit{'replacement object for [a] dependency'} [TODO5] are often used in these types of test to remain cheap
    to run. Mocks stop expensive calls to databases or web requests by providing a pre-programmed response that the test can use instead. Due to their 
    lower cost unit tests can be ran before every deployment. This will be described more in the \hyperref[sec:Deployment]{\textbf{Deployment}} 
    section that follows.

    \item \textbf{Integration Tests} - Unlike the aforementioned unit tests, integration tests want to test the actual functionality of the system, thus 
    making them more costly. Or in other words \textit{'Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well
    together'} [TODO4]. These are run on a schedule rather than at deployment to help lower the overall expenditure of testing. 
  
    \item \textbf{End-to-end (E2E) Tests} - End-to-end tests, also known as UI tests, \textit{'replicates a user behavior with the software'} [TODO4].
    This is done on software that is either live, or functions the exact same way the live system does. This is the most expensive type of testing as
    it often requires a large overhead to run. For example a library like Puppeteer [TODO6] uses the chromium browser to make network requests to a 
    specified test url and then replicates user actions and runs assertions based on those actions. This is a lot more CPU intensive work than the 
    previous tests, and similar to integration tests should be run on a schedule. These types of tests are the smallest area of testing however due 
    to their increased cost.

  \begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
      \hline
      \textbf{Test Name}    & \textbf{Test Type}  & \textbf{Cadence}  \\ \hline
      UI tests              & E2E                 & Twice a week      \\ \hline
      Booking tests         & Integration         & Daily             \\ \hline
      Payments tests        & Integration         & Daily             \\ \hline     
      Account tests         & Integration         & Daily             \\ \hline     
      Car tests             & Integration         & Daily             \\ \hline   
      P2P/Blockchain tests  & E2E                 & Weekly            \\ \hline 
      Unit tests            & Unit                & On deployment     \\ \hline    
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table showing ACMEs tests and testing pattern}
  \end{table}

  The above table shows ACME's testing patterns. Most is quite self-explanatory, the only strange one is that P2P/Blockchain and UI tests are not on 
  the same cadence. This was a decision made due to cost. Blockchains require a gas fee [TODO7] when transacting on them. If this is done on a live 
  environment this is going to cost money to pay that fee. Therefore I have lowered this testing suite down to once a week instead of twice.
