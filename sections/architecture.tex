\section{Architecture of the new system}

  \subsection{Overall Architecture}
  Cloud native

  \subsection{Sub Architectures}
  This solution will be built primarily using a cloud-native approach, however as this system is somewhat large there is room for other 
  architectural patterns to be used in sub systems of the overall build. Below follow diagrams of both the proposed systems, including third party 
  integrations showing metamask and Stripe, and a diagram showing the overlap of these different design patterns.
