\section{Dependability}
  \label{sec:Dependability}
  In the following section I will discuss how the proposed architecture for the new ACME system is dependable. In his book \textit{Software Engineering}, Ian 
  Sommerville describes the term dependability to mean \textit{'The dependability of a computer system is a property of the system that reflects its 
  trustworthiness.'} [TODO]. He the breaks this down into 5 sections which I will now discuss.
