\section{Conclusion}
  To conclude, in this report I have discussed the architecture that ACME uses in its newly created system. A cloud-native approach is the best 
  approach when considering ACME prior paper based system, due to setup cost and speed. This system is V \& V approved due to its rigorous, testing,
  deployment and requirements gathering to ensure what's being built is correct and of high quality.

  In addition to this the system also has protections for safety and security concerns, some of which can be provided by AWS, but also internal systems
  such as IP/user blacklists ans support channels on the web app. The language and packages used are modern and well tested preventing certain attacks
  like buffer overflows out the box.

  In addition to this, the adoption of an agile approach allows the team to make changes in the future to make their service even better for the customer.
