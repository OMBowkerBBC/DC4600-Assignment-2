\section{Introduction}

  In this report I will expand on the work done previously for the company known as ACME. A system has been designed for the company to 
  move into a more digital and online world. This system was designed around the following business goal:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Increase profits/customers
    \item Improve documentation resilience and navigability
    \item Cater to the student demographic
    \item Automate/speed up time intensive tasks
  \end{itemize}

  This new system was designed to move ACME away from a slow, clunky paper-based system which was slow to update and had little to no \textit{'backup-ability'}
  as well as from using a phone/email based communication both internally and for customers. In addition to this they wanted to take advantage of the younger  
  student population, research in the previous work concluded that adding cryptocurrency payments could be a goo way to engage this younger audience as well as
  be an interesting point for marketing. The new software system would move all the old functionality into a software based approach, these features include:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Adding customer information
    \item Taking payment
    \item Handling the return of a vehicle
    \item Starting a new hire
    \item Adding a new car to the system
  \end{itemize}

  This report will continue this work by looking at the project in terms of architectural design, any security and safety concerns that could arise from the 
  project and how the software will handle faults and promote resilience. I have included the sequence diagrams from the previous work in 
  \hyperref[sec:AppendixA]{\textbf{Appendix A}} to help understand the flow of the new systems.
