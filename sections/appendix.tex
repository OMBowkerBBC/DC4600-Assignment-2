\subsection{Appendix B - Architectural design of system using AWS}
\label{sec:AppendixB}

  This solution will be built primarily using a cloud-native approach, however as this system is somewhat large there is room for other 
  architectural patterns to be used in sub systems of the overall build. Below is a high level look at how the system could be create using AWS:

  \end{figure}

  The main component is the Server Side Rendered front end. This can then communicate with the blockchain for crypto transactions using a wallet provider,
  e.g. Metamask [18]. The main functionality is that the front end is then able to send events through EventBridge [19] to individual lambdas [20] for different 
  functionality. These lambdas can then store data into the database. The payment lambda uses Stripe [21] to process payments, and the \textit{'car lambda'} is
  for internal use only, hence the lock on its connection. These topics will be discussed more in the 
  \hyperref[sec:Dependability]{\textbf{Dependability}} section.
